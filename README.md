*"Quick Twitch random user picker"*
>⚠️ This repository has been abandoned. ⚠️

Application that pulls data from events from your Twitch channel to create a list of Twitch users that have either subscribed, received a gifted subscription or gifted somebody else a subscription to your channel, at the current time of running the application.

Instances of a user appearing in the list can be created by subscribing, gifting, or gifted.

Intent is to select a user out of the list and select one user.

------------


For example :

| Username  | Action  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| johnsmith123 | subscribed |
| mikedean321 | gifted |
| johnsmith123 | gifter |
| johnsmith123 | gifter |



If a single user subscribes once, and gifts 10 subscriptions, they have 11 chances to be selected.


## Planned features
- See your statistics about your current subscribers
- Export a beautified csv list of current subscribers
- Export a txt list of current subscribers
- Select a random subscriber / gifter from list of current subscribers
